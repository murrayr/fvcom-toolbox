% Extract river discharges from the supplied river positions for the FVCOM
% grid in Mobj.
%
% get_EHYPE_rivers(Mobj, dist_thresh)
%
% DESCRIPTION:
%   For the positions in Mobj.rivers.positions, find the nearest
%   unstructured grid node and extract the river discharge from
%   Mobj.rivers.river_flux. The river positions must fall within the
%   specified distance (dist_thresh). If multiple rivers are assigned to
%   the same node, the river with the larger of the set of discharges is
%   used.
%
% INPUT:
%   Mobj - MATLAB mesh object containing:
%       * have_lonlat - boolean to check for spherical coordinates.
%       * lon, lat - positions for the unstructured grid.
%       * tri - triangulation table for the unstructured grid.
%       * nVerts - number of nodes in the grid.
%       * read_obc_nodes - open boundary node IDs.
%       * rivers - river data struct with the following fields:
%           - positions - river positions in lon, lat.
%           - names - list of river names
%           - river_flux - path to the EHYPE ASCII file data directory.
%   dist_thresh - maximum distance away from a river node beyond
%       which the search for an FVCOM node is abandoned. Units in degrees.
%   model_year - [optional] when giving climatology, a year must be
%       specified so that the time series can be anchored in time. The
%       returned time series will be 3 years long centred on the specified
%       year. Discharges will be repeated for the two additional years.
%
% OUTPUT:
%   Mobj.river_flux - volume flux at the nodes within the model domain.
%   Mobj.river_nodes - node IDs for the rivers. At the moment, these are
%       point sources only. Eventually, some rivers may have to be split
%       over several nodes.
%   Mobj.river_names - river names which fall within the model domain. For
%       rivers where the discharge has been summed, the name is compoud,
%       with each contributing name separated by a hyphen (-).
%   Mobj.river_time - time series for the river discharge data
%
% EXAMPLE USAGE:
%   Mobj = get_EHYPE_rivers(Mobj, 0.15)
%
% Author(s):
%   Pierre Cazenave (Plymouth Marine Laboratory)
%
% Revision history:
%   2013-10-15 - First version based on get_FVCOM_rivers.m.
%   2013-11-14 - Update the help to reflect the functionality.
%   2013-11-15 - Add support for using a river climatology from the E-HYPE
%   time series data (must be precomputed) instead of a specified section
%   of the E-HYPE model output.
%   2013-12-12 - Remove some redundant variables.
%   2013-12-13 - Remove the loop through the time at the end and instead
%   use greg2mjulian to work on the whole time vector array.
%   2014-01-22 - For nodes with mulitple rivers assigned, use the largest
%   of the rivers rather than summing their fluxes. Also eliminate having
%   two adjacent river nodes (instead use the average of their flux and
%   assign the position to the first river node).

% Some of the river fluxes are being assigned to adjacent coastal nodes.
% This is no good because we end up putting too much water in (similar
% problem to the multiple river inputs on a single node which is fixed in
% the loop above). So, we need to check each node and check its neighbours
% aren't also rivers. If one (or more?) is, then we need to pick the larger
% discharge (as defined by the mean over the entire time series) and use
% that, removing the other node from the list.

% Finding the neighbouring nodes is not as straightforward as it might seem
% at first. Simply using poly2cw is no good because our coastline is too
% complicated for that (poly2cw assumes a convex hull). So, we'll find the
% 2 nearest coastline nodes to each river node. If any of those 2 is also a
% river, then merge the two rivers together (use the mean discharge).

% This breaks down a bit when three rivers are adjacent to one another, but
% most of the time that shouldn't happen...

% Build a list of the nodes we're considering as neighbouring in
% fv_dups_idx and fv_keep_idx. Store the meaned flow in fv_dups_flow (we'll
% remove the original un-meaned flows at the end). Also store the
% duplicated names in fv_dups_names. All these duplicate arrays will be
% sorted out after the loop to find the adjacent nodes has finished. This
% is less horrible than looping through and adjusting the values in the
% original arrays because the mean of a meaned value and a new value is not
% the same as the mean of the three original values, that is:
