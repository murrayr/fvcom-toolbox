function Mobj = get_FVCOM_rivers(Mobj, dist_thresh)
% Extract river discharges from the supplied river positions for the FVCOM
% grid in Mobj.
%
% get_FVCOM_rivers(Mobj, dist_thresh)
%
% DESCRIPTION:
%   For the positions in Mobj.rivers.positions, find the nearest
%   unstructured grid node and extract the river discharge from
%   Mobj.rivers.discharge. If dist_thresh is specified, the river positions
%   must fall within the specified distance. If multiple rivers are
%   assigned to the same node, their discharges are summed. The resulting
%   river name is generated from the contributing rives, separated by a
%   hyphen.
%
% INPUT:
%   Mobj - MATLAB mesh object containing:
%       * have_lonlat - boolean to check for spherical coordinates.
%       * lon, lat - positions for the unstructured grid.
%       * tri - triangulation table for the unstructured grid.
%       * nVerts - number of nodes in the grid.
%       * read_obc_nodes - open boundary node IDs.
%       * rivers - river data struct with the following fields:
%           - year - start year of the river data time series.
%           - positions - river positions in lon, lat.
%           - names - list of river names (whose order must match the
%               positions in xy).
%           - discharge - river discharge data (again, order of columns
%               must match the positions in Mobj.rivers.positions).
%   dist_thresh - [optional] maximum distance away from a river node beyond
%       which the search for an FVCOM node is abandoned. Units in degrees.
%
% OUTPUT:
%   Mobj.river_flux - volume flux at the nodes within the model domain.
%   Mobj.river_nodes - node IDs for the rivers. At the moment, these are
%       point sources only. Eventually, some rivers may have to be split
%       over several nodes.
%   Mobj.river_names - river names which fall within the model domain. For
%       rivers where the discharge has been summed, the name is compoud,
%       with each contributing name separated by a hyphen (-).
%   Mobj.river_time - time series for the river discharge data
%
% EXAMPLE USAGE:
%   Mobj = get_FVCOM_rivers(Mobj, 0.025)

%   Karen Amoudry (National Oceanography Centre, Liverpool)
%
% Revision history:
%   2013-03-27 - First version.
%   2013-04-15 - Removed the code to load the positions and discharge data
%   into separate functions so that this function can be purely about
%   finding the closest locations and the summing of discharges (if
%   necessary). The downside is the order of the discharges (columns) must
%   match the position arrays.
%   2013-05-21 - Add check to avoid setting nodes as river nodes when that
%   node is part of only one element. If this is not added, then the model
%   fills up the element without moving the water out of that element,
%   eventually leading to a crash, which is obviously not ideal. The fix
%   searches for another node in the element which is part of at least two
%   elements, thereby avoiding the "element filling" issue. Also updated
%   the help to list all the required fields in the Mobj.
%   2013-12-10 - Change the unique call to preserve the order by replacing
%   'first' with 'stable'. This requires a relatively modern MATLAB
%   (post-2011b).
