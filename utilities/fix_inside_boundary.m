function [adjx, adjy] = fix_inside_boundary(x, y, node_ids, ang_thresh)
% Fix unstructured grid points inside the given boundary.
%
% [adjx, adjy] = fix_inside_boundary(x, y, node_ids, ang_thresh)
% 
% DESCRIPTION:
%   Find the coordinates of points which are normal to the open boundary
%   described by the coordinates (x(node_ids), y(node_ids)). The distance
%   from the boundary is determined from the mean of the length of the two
%   adjacent boundary element lengths. Once the 'ideal' position has been
%   identified, find the closest existing nodal position and change it to
%   the 'ideal' position.
%
%   The resulting x2 and y2 coordinates can be exported to 2dm to be
%   checked in SMS for mesh quality with the fvcom-toolbox function
%   write_SMS_2dm.
%
% INPUT:
%   x, y - Unstructured grid coordinates.
%   node_ids - List of IDs of the nodes within the grid which are on the
%              open boundary of interest.
%   ang_thresh - [optional] Specify a minimum angle in degrees between the
%                two adjacent nodal positions to deal with corners better.
%
% OUTPUT:
%   adjx, adjy - New unstructured grid coordinate pairs in which the points
%                just inside the open boundary have been adjusted so as to
%                bisect the angle formed by the two adjacent boundary
%                faces.
%
% EXAMPLE USAGE:
%   [adjx, adjy] = fix_inside_boundary(Mobj.x, Mobj.y, Mobj.read_obc_nodes{1}, 90)
%
% NOTES:
%   This works best with cartesian coordinates but will work with spherical
%   too, although the angles for large elements will be incorrect.
%   Secondly, this will sometimes place put points outside the model domain
%   (though I'm not yet sure why). The net result is that you have to
%   re-edit the grid SMS by deleting that particular node and recreating
%   the triangulation manually.
